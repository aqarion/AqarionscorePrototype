{   "description": "AQARIONZ Core Prototype – a sovereign, local-first multi-agent lab that turns signals, questions, and stories into harmonics, visuals, and research logs. FastAPI backend plus a simple three-pane web UI (Signal Lab, OuijaAI, Sovereignty Map) as a minimal, extensible reality-engine scaffold." }
